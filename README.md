In this project an architecture was written and tested to perform OCR text detection of distorted text in various fonts, capitalisations, and noise, and given modelled performed well, attaining 70–80% accuracy on multiple randomly generatesed testsets with small sizes of 4000–5000 and attaining 90%+ accuracy upon increasing dataset size to 50000.
Code was tested on google colab as ipynb's but here attached is the converted python file for the same.

This project implements and tests a custom architecture for OCR text detection on distorted text containing various fonts, capitalizations, and noise.

The model demonstrated strong performance:
- **70–80% accuracy** on small, randomly generated test sets (4,000–5,000 samples)
- **90%+ accuracy** when trained on larger datasets (50,000+ samples)

Development and testing were done in Google Colab using Jupyter notebooks. The attached `.py` file is a converted version of the notebook. You can run it locally or paste the code cell-by-cell into a Colab notebook to reproduce the results.
